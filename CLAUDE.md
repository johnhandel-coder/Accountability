# the U — Accountability App

## Overview
"the U" is a mobile-first HTML/CSS/JS web app that helps users break free from porn addiction through accountability, scripture, daily tracking, and milestone badges.

## Branding
- **Name:** the U
- **Logo:** Circular black badge with white condensed text — "the" in lowercase light weight, "U" in bold uppercase
- **Design language:** Dark, minimal, bold. Inspired by the logo's aesthetic.
- **Color scheme:** Pure black background (#0a0a0a), white text, minimal color accents (green for success, red for falls, gold for badges)
- **Typography:** Inter font, heavy weights (700-900), uppercase headings, wide letter-spacing

## Tech Stack
- **Single-page HTML app** — all code in `index.html` (inline CSS + JS)
- **No backend** — localStorage under key `theu_data`
- **PWA-ready** — `manifest.json` for home screen install
- **Mobile-first** — safe-area-inset support for iPhone notch

## App Structure (Screens)
All screens are `<div class="screen">` toggled via JS:

1. **Setup Screen** (`#setup-screen`) — 3-step onboarding:
   - Step 1: Welcome with "the U" logo
   - Step 2: Add accountability partners (name + phone)
   - Step 3: Enter name and "why" statement

2. **Dashboard** (`#dashboard-screen`):
   - Greeting + streak counter
   - **SOS Button** — pulsing circle, opens SOS modal
   - **Check-in** — two buttons: ✓ "Stayed Pure" and ✗ "I Fell"
     - Each triggers an encouragement message (slide-down banner)
     - Clean check-ins: victory encouragements
     - Falls: grace encouragements (no condemnation)
   - Next badge progress card

3. **Calendar** (`#calendar-screen`):
   - Stats: current streak, best streak, total clean days
   - Monthly grid — tap to cycle: empty → clean (green ✓) → fell (red ✗) → empty
   - Navigate months with arrows

4. **Badges** (`#badges-screen`):
   - Grid of 11 milestones based on consecutive clean days
   - Earned badges glow gold; locked badges are dimmed
   - Badge popup appears when a new milestone is hit

5. **Settings** (`#settings-screen`):
   - Edit name and "why"
   - Manage partners
   - Reset all data

6. **SOS Modal** (`#sos-modal`):
   - Random Bible verse (20 curated, purity/temptation themed)
   - User's "why" statement
   - "Text My Partner" — opens native SMS via `sms:` protocol

## Badge Milestones
| Badge | Days | Icon |
|-------|------|------|
| First Step | 1 | 🌱 |
| 3 Day Warrior | 3 | ⚔️ |
| One Week | 7 | 🔥 |
| Two Weeks | 14 | 💪 |
| Three Weeks | 21 | 🛡️ |
| One Month | 30 | ⭐ |
| Two Months | 60 | 🌟 |
| Three Months | 90 | 👑 |
| Six Months | 180 | 🏔️ |
| Nine Months | 270 | 🦅 |
| One Year | 365 | 🏆 |

## Data Model (`localStorage` key: `theu_data`)
```json
{
  "setupComplete": true,
  "userName": "string",
  "userWhy": "string",
  "partners": [{ "name": "string", "phone": "string" }],
  "checkedDays": { "YYYY-MM-DD": "clean" | "fell" },
  "earnedBadges": { "day1": true },
  "shownBadges": { "day1": true }
}
```

Note: `checkedDays` values changed from `true` to `"clean"` | `"fell"` to support the ✓/✗ check-in system.

## Development Rules
- **NEVER break existing user data.** When adding new fields to the data structure, always provide fallback defaults (e.g. `appData.newField || []`). Never rename or remove existing fields without migration code. Never change the localStorage key (`theu_data`).
- **If a change has ANY potential to lose user data, stop and ask the user before proceeding.**

## Key Design Decisions
- **SMS via `sms:` protocol** — no backend needed
- **Check-in has two options** — ✓ (stayed pure) and ✗ (I fell), with different encouragement messages for each
- **Encouragement system** — 10 victory messages, 8 grace messages (for falls — no shame, only grace)
- **Badges earned on streak** — consecutive clean days, popup celebration when earned
- **Calendar tri-state** — days cycle through: unchecked → clean → fell → unchecked
- **No Google Fonts dependency for logo** — logo is pure CSS text

## File Inventory
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `index.html` | Entire app (HTML + CSS + JS) |
| `manifest.json` | PWA manifest for home screen install |
| `CLAUDE.md` | This file — project context for AI assistance |

## Future Enhancement Ideas
- Service worker for offline support
- App icons (icon-192.png, icon-512.png)
- Text all partners (currently first partner only)
- Daily reminder notifications
- Journal/notes feature
- Export/share streak data
- Animated confetti on badge earn
